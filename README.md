# hello-world

This is my first repository. am learning about github features so i know how to use it. 

Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others. - this is from the getting started guide https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Steps
1) Make repository
2) Make a branch
3) Make changes/edits and commit changes (with optional commit comments)
4) Pull requests
